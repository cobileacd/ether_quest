# Ether Quest
Project for ICG (Introdução à Computação Gráfica)

Final Grade: ```18```

## Context
The initial idea was to develop a roguelike game, inspired by Hades. What began as merely a helper for level design evolved into an (almost) fully featured scene editor with numerous game features implemented:

* Character and enemy animations
* Collision detection
* Add, move, copy, and remove models and lights
* Visual editor helpers
* Skybox integration
* Simple combat system
* Enemy AI
* Smooth camera movement
* Save/load scene functionality
* Dynamic model loading
  
## Future Development
I intend to build on the current project with the following enhancements:

- Refactor the codebase
- Implement enemy random spawn mechanics
- Introduce more enemy types
- Design a boss with a special moveset
- Improve AI with patrol behavior and random walk patterns
- Enhance the user interface (UI)
- Improve the model loader
- Develop a dialog system for character interactions
- Optimize performance
- Add power-ups
- Expand levels to provide more extensive content and challenges

## Publish
The game is hosted under: https://cobileacd.github.io/ether_quest/

## How to Run
To start the Three.js app, run the following command in a terminal:

```npx vite```

To enable scene saving, start a separate terminal and run:

```npm run```
